\section{Introduction}

The LSST Science Requirements Document defines a set of normative science performance metrics for the LSST, driven by the four science themes - studying the nature of dark matter and dark energy, exploring the dynamic and transient sky, mapping the Milky Way, and taking an inventory of the Solar System\cite{2019ApJ...873..111I}.

In this document, we present the detailed algorithms for all the normative science performance metrics defined in the SRD, LSR, OSS and DMSR.
Many requirements will have more than one requirement identifier.
This reflects the fact that many high-level requirements are flowed down to the ultimate subsystem that is responsible for implementing the metric. 
For convenience, links are provided to all the requirements that describe the same metric. 

The document is organized into two high-level sections for the normative metrics defined in the LSST SRD and derived documents and all other metrics. 

Appendix \ref{app:metric-template} provides a template for adding a new metric definition
